INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOCAL TESTING:

Clone this repository into you device and change the current directory to its root directory. 
  
Create a .env file inside the directory and set up the following:

DATABASE_URL= the local address of your psql database

SECRET_KEY= your own secret key here 

Next activate the virtual environment and install dependencies listed on requirements.txt:

$ python3 -m venv venv

$ source venv/bin/activate

$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt

IMPORTANT! Then add the SQL schemas AND the testdata. The testdata is dummydata that is located in testdata.sql.


This will showcase the app functionality better.

So do the following: 

First:

$ psql < schema.sql

Then:

$ psql < testdata.sql

Then you can run

$ flask run
